# Glossary

### AI - Artificial Intelligence
AI refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, learning, reasoning, and understanding natural language.

### ML - Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through learning from data, without being explicitly programmed.

### DL - Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning that involves artificial neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks). It has been particularly successful in tasks such as image and speech recognition.

### NLP - Natural Language Processing

NLP is a branch of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful.

### CV - Computer Vision

Computer Vision is a field within AI that enables computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world, such as images and videos. It is often used in applications like object recognition and image analysis.

### RL - Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. It receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties and adjusts its actions to maximize cumulative rewards.

### GAN - Generative Adversarial Network

GANs are a type of neural network architecture used in unsupervised machine learning. They consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, that compete with each other to generate realistic data, often used in generating images, videos, or text.

### CNN - Convolutional Neural Network

CNNs are a class of deep neural networks commonly used in computer vision tasks. They are designed to automatically and adaptively learn patterns and features from images through convolutional layers.

### RNN - Recurrent Neural Network

RNNs are a type of neural network architecture designed for sequence data. They are capable of processing data with sequential dependencies, making them suitable for tasks like natural language processing and time-series analysis.

### IoT - Internet of Things

IoT refers to the network of interconnected physical devices and objects (things) embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity to collect and exchange data. AI and machine learning are often used in analyzing IoT data for various applications.
