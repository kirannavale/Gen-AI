## Why You Should Learn AI? Why Now?
The development and deployment of the right AI technologies can offer numerous advantages. These range from automating routine tasks and improving customer experiences to reducing error-prone processes, fostering creativity, and creating innovative AI-driven products.

**Don't believe me?** 

Here are a couple of examples: 

• Routine tasks automation = custom AI systems for e.g. large files summarization/description

• Customer experience enhancement = personalized AI assistants

• Creativity boost = AI-generated videos for ad campaigns

• Reduction of error-prone processes = AI-based generation of reports/dashboards

• AI-based product development = ANYTHING YOU CAN IMAGINE (literally limitless possibilities)


## Who Is This Roadmap For?
This roadmap is ideal for technical product leaders, technology professionals, consultants, entrepreneurs, UX/UI designers and specialists who would like to create AI systems for the future that amazes.


## Preliminaries
This roadmap has been designed with simplicity in mind. It has been created as accessible as possible to everyone interested in entering the field of Generative AI and exploring its potential. However, before diving into the world of Generative AI, you'll need a few "survival" skills.

It is beneficial to have the following **basic** knowledge: 

• Python

• Mathematics (Algebra & Calculus)

• Statistics (Probability)

• Cloud (e.g., Azure)

If you have this - you're good to follow most of the technical content of this roadmap.

## FAQ
### How Much Does It Cost?
The GenAI Learning Roadmap is, and will always be, 100% FREE.

### How Long Does It Take To Complete?
The journey through our GenAI Learning Roadmap is a personal adventure, and the time it takes to complete is as unique as you are. Why? Because learning is not a "one-size-fits-all" experience. The pace of your progress depends on various factors, such as:

• Your knowledge

• Your dedication

• Your ability to stay focused, etc.

This roadmap was designed with flexibility in mind. Whether you're diving in full-time or dedicating a few hours a week, you're in control. Take the time you need to grasp each concept and explore at your own rhythm.

Rough estimation: A person with basic Python skills, some math knowledge, and an understanding of cloud concepts might complete the roadmap in approx. **50-70 hours**.

### How Can You Support?
There are two ways you can support me: 

<!-- ToDo: Add support mechanisms. Find benchmarks -->
